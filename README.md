## Changelog

CV is forked from [danhje/latex-resume](https://github.com/danhje/latex-resume) and modified to my liking.

Changes:

- custom accent color (thanks to [@kvalkanova](https://github.com/kvalkanova))
- adds `about` section
- adds `entrySimple` environment which allows for entries in main column without description
- adds `contactPublic` environment  to allow for public and private versions which either omit or print address and phone number
- cleans up file structure substantially
- fixes some inconsistencies in module referencing
- builds via `Make` or `Snakemake`
- Snakemake rule `cv_target` converts PDF to JPG to include as screenshot in README (requires imagekick)
